    <div class = "msoft">
        <p>
            Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> interpreters for the Altair 8800.
            It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows.
            the company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an
            estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">IBM</a>, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time,
            approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.Microsoft launched its first retail version
            of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating
            system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due 
            to mounting creative differences.
